### About the app
The app was created to calculate scores in games like scrabble, to keep track of the players' scores.

Users should be able to:

- Get how to use the app in the rules' modal.
- Add players one by one or through a comma.
- Edit or delete each player, also delete all at once.
- Add score to a particular player and see the last added score of each player.
- Show and hide each player's current score.
- Reset all scores.
- Keep states after page's refreshing.
